/// @brief A growing implementation of the OpenAPI Specification.
///
/// This module reports where an OpenAPI Description declares its JSON Schemas
/// and leaves what is inside them to a JSON Schema implementation.
///
/// This functionality is included as follows:
///
/// ```cpp
/// #include <sourcemeta/core/openapi.h>
/// ```

enum class OpenAPIVersion : std::uint8_t {

};

/// @ingroup openapi
/// Determine the version of an OpenAPI Description from its `openapi` field
/// without framing it, returning no value for a version we do not recognise
/// and for anything that declares no such field to read.
/// The patch component of the field carries no meaning, so every `3.1.x`
/// release maps to the same result. For example:
///
/// ```cpp
/// #include <sourcemeta/core/json.h>
/// #include <sourcemeta/core/openapi.h>
/// #include <cassert>
///
/// const auto document{sourcemeta::core::parse_json(R"({

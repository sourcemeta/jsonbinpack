// OpenAPI Specification 3.1.1, Section 4.8.25: a `mapping` entry "maps a
// specific property value to either a different schema component name, or to a
// schema identified by a URI". Only the latter is a reference, as Section
// 4.3.3 lists the name form among the connections a description makes by name,
// and Section 4.8.25 settles which of the two a value is:
//
//   The behavior of a `mapping` value that is both a valid schema name and a
//   valid relative URI reference is implementation-defined, but it is
//   RECOMMENDED that it be treated as a schema name. To ensure that an
//   ambiguous value (e.g. `"foo"`) is treated as a relative URI reference by
//   all implementations, authors MUST prefix it with the `"."` path segment
//
// OpenAPI Specification 3.2.1, Section 4.25.3 says the same of the default a
// Discriminator Object may declare beside the map, which is what holds the two
// of them to the one rule: "The behavior of a `mapping` value or
// `defaultMapping` value that is both a valid schema name and a valid relative
// URI reference is implementation-defined"
//
// A schema name is what the Components Object takes as a key, and the path
// segment an author writes to force the other reading is no such key. Whether
// a value holds up as one is asked of the value alone rather than of what the
// description declares, as Section 4.8.25 calls `"foo"` ambiguous without
// regard to whether a component goes by that name
// Keep what one of those names, where it names a schema by URI rather than by
// the name a component goes by. Section 4.8.25 types a mapping as holding
// "schema names or URI references", so a value that holds up as neither is one
// nothing can read, which is what every other field this specification types
// as a URI is held to as well
